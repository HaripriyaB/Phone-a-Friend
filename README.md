## Phone-a-Friend
This project is build in HTML5, Php and PostgreSql database as backend support.
## Features
* Configure your own database
* Create a new contact
* Delete Contact
* Search contact by name, phone number
* Date Calculation

## Inspiration
It is inspired from a typical phone directory in our mobile phones. The concept shown here is to have a local phone directory along with the contact details of our friends under one single umbrella. We know that in today's world we can't meet people often like in the olden days because the distance of our acquaintances is increasing day by day. So to contact them whenever we want, we need a record of out friends, family and necessary people contact in one place. So this project solves this issue.

## What it does
 It typically does all the basic things like insertion, deletion in a phone book. Additionally I've created a page for date calculation. Explanations below.
The functionalities as as follows:
* Configure : this is a setup of database(postgresql). Pgsql needs a host name, port number and a database name for it to start it's work.
* Insert a contact : Insert a new contact with related information.
* Delete a contact : Delete a contact by entering his/her name and phone numbers.
* Search a contact: Search a contact by Firstname / Lastname / by phone number. 
* Calculate Age : Calculate age of each person in the phone book. You can even compare their age with another person.
## How I built it
Firstly the HTML and CSS part was made.
Basic PHP, CSS, HTML5, Database used is PostgreSql.
XAMPP server was installed to run the app. 
Start the server and then open localhost:81/MainPage.php 

## Challenges I ran into
I was new to database and learnt the basic insertion, deletion and searching techniques and made this application working. I even realized I'm very bad at styling and I tried my best to put some random colors which is suitable.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I successfully connected Pgsql admin database with my app and now it is running on my local machine with Xampp server.

## What I learned
I learned Database(Pgsql) and PHP from scratch. I also learnt how to use PgAdmin in my local system.


## What's next for Phone-a-Friend
Next I am planning to deploy it on a domain and publish it in the web soon :-)
